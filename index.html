<h3> What is Java ?</h3>
<p>
  Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

Java was developed by <em>Sun Microsystems</em> (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. <em>James Gosling</em> is known as the father of Java.
 Before Java, its name was <em>Oak</em>. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

<h3>Characterstics of Java</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <strong> Object oriented:</strong>  in java everyting is an object. Java can be easily extended .Therefore it is based on object model.
  </li>
<li>
<strong>Platform Independent:</strong>Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled,
it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform-independent byte code.
This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Simple:</strong>Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.

</li>
<li>
<strong>Secure:</strong>With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Architecture:</strong>neutral:Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.
</li>
<li>  <strong>.Portable:</strong>Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. The compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
</li>
<li>

<strong>Robust:</strong>Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
</li>
<li>
<strong> Multithreaded:</strong> With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.

<h3> Hello World Program :</h3>
<p>
  <hr />
  <br>
  public class MyFirstJavaProgram {
<br />
   public static void main(String []args) {
     <br>
      System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
      <br />
   }
   <br />
}
<br />
<strong>OUTPUT:</strong> Hello World
<hr />
